 With the PlayHorny services (hereinafter referred to as the \"\"Service(s)\"\"), in addition to having access to free games, you'll also be able to make purchases with legal tender on top-up credits and other paid items provided by the Service. You must be at least 18 years old or confirm that you have reached the legal age of adulthood in your residence jurisdiction/country to make purchases. When you confirm a purchase, your designated payment method and the payment information provided will be passed onto a third-party payment processor to handle the related charges. You will also receive an electronic invoice via email.
 You understand and agree that all charges incurred in your account, regardless of whether they were incurred by you personally, must be borne by you. Even after account cancellation or termination, we retain the right to charge you for the payment incurred prior to the cancellation or termination."</string>
    <string name="hcoin_terms_08">"5. HCoin

 Based on the methods of acquisition, there are 2 types of HCoin:

1. Paid HCoin: 
 After obtaining Paid HCoin through transactions (hereinafter referred to as \"Paid HCoin\"): Paid HCoin is obtained through purchases with legal tender and can be used for payments within specific games for virtual currency, virtual items, or other services. Paid HCoin will be stored as digital assets in the user's account.
2. Free HCoin:
 Free HCoin (hereinafter referred to as \"Free HCoin\") is obtained through the Platform Services and holds the same value as Paid HCoin. Users can acquire Free HCoin through specific activities or meeting certain conditions, and can use it on payments for virtual currency, virtual items, or other in-game services. Free HCoin will be stored as a time-limited digital asset in the user's account, and you are not to request a refund, transfer, or conversion of it.

 A certain amount of HPower obtained while using the Platform's services or making purchases with \"Paid HCoin\" is issued as a gift and cannot be refunded by the user. HPower can be used exclusively on the Platform to purchase various services and items offered by the Platform, and only within the Platform. In cases where a user account holds both Paid HCoin and Free HCoin, the Platform will prioritize using Free HCoin for any payment. Only when the Free HCoin balance is insufficient will Paid HCoin be consumed. 

 We retain the ownership, possession, issuing, and any related rights over the HCoin. While the owners or operators of the games are responsible for the issuance of their respective virtual currency and virtual items, we are only responsible for the HCoin sold on the websites operated by the Platform. We are not responsible for HCoin obtained through unofficial other methods, and such HCoin shall not be used on the Platform. To protect your own rights, please refrain from acquiring any virtual currency or virtual items on platforms not operated by us."</string>
    <string name="hcoin_terms_09">"6. Period of Validity

 HCoin obtained through purchases with legal tender is not subject to any expiration limitations and can be used all year round, as is also the case with HPower. However, for Free HCoin obtained through Platform services, there is a validity period of 180 days, starting from the date of acquisition. The expired Free HCoin will be invalidated automatically and cannot be refunded, compensated, redeemed, or reactivated in any way.
 You understand and agree that any losses incurred due to the expiration of Free HCoin will be your own responsibility."</string>
    <string name="hcoin_terms_10">"7. Usage Restrictions

 You agree that the HCoin you hold on the Platform is for your personal and limited use only. You must not transfer, share, lease, exchange, trade, gift, sell, authorize, or in any way convert HCoin, HPower, virtual currency, virtual items, or any other items purchased on the Platform to legal tender or items equivalent to their value. In the case that your user account is suspended or terminated, the HCoin, HPower, virtual currency, virtual items, and any other items purchased through Platform services within your account will be invalidated automatically and no longer be available."</string>
    <string name="hcoin_terms_11">"8. Refunds

 Once you have used legal tender to purchase HCoin, items provided by the Services, HPower, in-game virtual currency or virtual items, etc., and after they are credited to your account, the HCoin consumed is typically non-refundable. The items and Services offered by the Platform are not subject to the 7-day period for goods returning under Article 19, Paragraph 1 of the Consumer Protection Act. Once they are distributed to your account, they cannot be returned or refunded. Please exercise caution and confirm the items, quantity, price, and other details when making a purchase, as purchases would take effect immediately, and no refunds will be provided unless certain conditions are met.

(1) In the case that a user terminates their contract with the Platform, which is to terminate their right to the usage of their account, they may apply for a refund. However, once the application is submitted, the account cannot be reinstated for any reason.
(2) The Platform also offers other promotional items (hereinafter referred to as \"Promotional Items\") available for purchase using legal currency. If a user wishes to return the purchased yet unused Promotional Items, we will determine the eligibility for refunds based on the purchase price, product nature, and other factors at the time of purchase before refunding the amount or HCoin accordingly.

After deducting the following costs and fees, we shall refund the unused \"Paid HCoin\" that was purchased with legal tender within 30 working days.
● The necessary costs include:
Fees collected by gateways, website operation costs, handling fees, etc.
● Remittance fees:
The fees incurred by the user's receiving bank due to the remittance.
● Other fees:
Personal fees arising from special circumstances in refunding.
Refund is calculated as follows: Deduct the aforementioned costs from the user's remaining unused \"Paid HCoin.\"

(3) In the case of the termination of a game provided by the Platform, resulting in the cessation of the user's use of their in-game account, if the game provider decides to entrust the Platform with the refund process, we shall be responsible for determining the amount of unused virtual currency in the game and assisting the user with the refund process. We will only refund virtual currency purchased with \"Paid HCoin.\" In this process, we will calculate the actual amount of in-game virtual currency and refund the corresponding amount of \"Paid HCoin\" based on the exchange rate of \"Paid HCoin.\"

 However, refunds will not be granted for the following reasons:
● The user violates the HCoin Terms of Use, Terms of Use, or Privacy Policy.
● The user has obtained HCoin through fraudulent, forged, modified, or other illegal means.
● We have a legitimate doubt in accordance with the law, force majeure factors, or other reasonable grounds that allow the temporary suspension of the user's right to their account."</string>

 The Platform reserves the right to modify the Terms at any time without prior notice. By continuing to read or access the Services provided by PlayHorny, you acknowledge that you have understood the content of the updated Terms and agreed to abide by them.

 You agree that for any damages or disadvantages incurred due to your inability to use HCoin, we shall not be responsible except as otherwise provided by law or in cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence.

This waiver and compensation provision applies to all violations described and covered in the entirety of the Terms."</string>

• Level Rewards
This is a rate based on which you will earn HCoin (Free) when topping up HCoin (Paid). Whenever it is available, this rate will be prioritized and applied to your top-ups to ensure that you receive the best value possible!

• Top-up Rewardable
This refers to the maximum amount of HCoin (Paid) that is eligible for calculating rewards during top-ups. The quota determines the amount of HCoin (Free) you will be able to earn. Only the top-up amount within this range is eligible for rewards. Any excess will not be counted.

• Reward Quota
This refers to the monthly limit of HCoin (Free) you can earn, calculated based on your Level Rewards and Top-up Rewardable. This quota resets each month within the validity period of your Party Card.

How to calculate: Level Rewards rate x Top-up Rewardable = Reward Quota

✦ Your Top-up Rewardable and Reward Quota reset monthly during the validity of the Party Card, with the reset date based on your Party Card activation date.
✦ Membership levels will be settled on Jun. 30th and Dec. 31st at 04:00 (GMT+8) annually, resetting the HPower accumulated for level-keeping to 0. The current level will be kept if met with the required HPower.
✦ If not, the current level will be lost and downgraded by one in the beginning of the new season, with the XP bar reset to 0.
✦ After obtaining the Party Card, you can start accumulating HPower required for leveling up your membership.
✦ Once the Party Card expires, HPower obtained through top-ups will no longer count toward the membership level system. The leveling up will stop, but your levels will continue to downgrade at each season settlement. Re-purchase the Party Card to resume the progress once more.
✦ Level Rewards will be applied first when topping up HCoin. They cannot be used alongside other promotions.
✦ If the next top-up triggers a level-up, the system will first calculate the top-up amount needed for the current level-up, with the remaining amount applied to the next level's reward calculation. Level Rewards cannot be used alongside other promotions.
✦ For more details regarding the Party Card, please refer to the PlayHorny [FAQs] section."</string>
